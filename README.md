# BSOD-Upon-Program-Run
(No superuser perms needed!) A program that bluescreens the computer upon the execution of a specific program, the default setting is upon the opening of a word document but you can change that simply by editing the "WINWORD.EXE" field in line 36. By default it runs forever checking the computer every 3 seconds for the stated program to be run.
